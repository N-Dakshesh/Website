						<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
						<p>I am currently studying MSci Physics at Imperial College London, and in the final year of my degree. Whilst studying physics, I've had to undertake multiple computational projects - mostly simulation or data analysis - which are detailed below. My main proficiency is in python, where I have extensive experience with numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas and pytorch, but I also have experience with mySQL.</p>

						<h2 class="major">Industrial Trajectory Planning using Reinforcement Learning: Technical University of Munich</h2>
						<p>
							<b>Modules used: pytorch, optuna, numpy. </b> <br> With advancements in laser technology, high powered lasers are now accessible to a wide range of manufacturers.
							This means the trajectory is now the limiting factor in the speed of industrial processes e.g. cutting, whereas
							previously the issue was limitations in laser power. Trajectories follow a specified path e.g. a square, but take into
							account the motor dynamics. The goal was to make an algorithm which would automatically find the fastest trajectory.
							After researching, I found the best approach to be to use reinforcement learning, shape the reward function to follow the path,
							and add an additional reward inversely proportional to the final time. The final implementation is an A2C algorithm, running in an
							environment that takes into account the dynamics model of the equipment to convert inputs into outputs. A recurrent neural network is used
							(since the dynamics model requires an integral - i.e. memory of past timesteps). It can successfully find the fastest time for a
							straight line path in 2D space, code.
							This is a basis for future research. I also experimented with automatic hyperparameter tuning using optuna,
							to try and increase learning time. <br>

						<h2 class="major">Modelling the shear modulus of cheese using a colloidal cheese model: Imperial College London</h2>
						<p>
							<b>Modules used: Scipy, numpy. </b> <br>
							Cheese can be modelled as a colloidal gel. For my bachelor project, to compare this fundamental model to an empirical model,
							I created a simulation of particles interacting as a colloidal gel under the predicted potential, and compared to real data
							and the empirical model. This required me to maximise performance and minimise memory usage, using tricks such as numpy's einsum function.
